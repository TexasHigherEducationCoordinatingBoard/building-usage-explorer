# University of North Texas Campus Buildings

## Summary
This notebook was prepared for the March, 2020, meeting of the Texas Association for Institutional Research in San Antonio, Texas. It shows how institional researchers can use a shapfile of their campus buildings to explore aggregated data on classroom enrollments. This demonstration project uses data from the University of North Texas (UNT).


## Data and Tools 
The Building and Room Report (CBM005) and the Facilities Building Inventory (CBM014) are reported by public colleges and universities in Texas to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.

Required input files:
* The Building and Room Report, CBM005 
* The Facilities Building Inventory, CBM014
* Shapfile of campus buildings - with building numbers in the metadata

Required Software:
* Python 3 - it's free and open source. I recommend installing the newest version with Anaconda. You'll also need to install the ArcGIS API for Python which is free for non-commercial purposes. 
* SAS (optional) - Python, R, STATA, or similar software could be used if you don't have a SAS license. 
* GDAL/OGR which is an open source set of geospatial tools.
* A simple text editor. I use MS Visual Studio Code.

**A big thanks to UNT for making the data available for this project!**
